@Description({
	"Make a player start or stop sprinting.",
	"If the player is not moving when this effect is used, they will be put in sprint mode for a tick and then stopped (this causes the FOV to change). "
		+ "Using it a second time, without the player manually sprinting in between, causes the player to stay in sprint mode, with some quirks.",
	" - Particles may not be produced under the player's feet.",
	" - The player will not exit the sprinting state if they stop moving.",
	" - Restrictions like low hunger will not prevent the player from sprinting",
	" - The player pressing shift will stop them sprinting, and pressing sprint will re-assert normal sprinting behavior",
	"Using this effect two or more consecutive times on a stationary player produces undefined behavior and should not be relied on."
